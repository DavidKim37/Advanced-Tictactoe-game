# Advanced Tic Tac Toe!

This program enables players to enjoy an obscure version of tic tac toe. Althought not finished, there will eventually be options to choose your own color.

## How to use

After running the code, you should see a blank screen that says "Enter to start." Press enter, and you will begin the game! Please refer to the rules if you would like to learn how to play (not implemented).

## File Descriptions

#### Note - Please ignore the weird file names

### General files

main.py - Many functions defined here, runs the starting menu which links to other files

README.md - Starting file detailing our program

### Code files


movepiece1.py - Contains the code that lets the user choose a space to go in, as well as the logic to deduce squares that are won.

printboard.py - Prints the board that shows the spaces that each player has captured.

### Other text files

zzzdump.txt - Pieces of our code we may need later (ex. testing things, old portions that may have been replaced, saving strings/data)

rules.txt - File the program reads when someone enters "3. Rules" in settings.  This is just to make the code itself less cluttered with a long string.

david's code playground.py - A useless file that David put for no reason.
